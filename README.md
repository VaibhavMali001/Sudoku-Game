# Sudoku-game
The Sudoku puzzle game project is built using Java. The primary focus of the project is to create an interactive Sudoku game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. To facilitate the construction of the graphical interface, JFrames will be used as the top-level containers provided by Java Swing.
